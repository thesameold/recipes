        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>There isn't anyone I know who doesn't love mashed potatoes. For various reasons, one may not
            eat them. Weight gain be damned, I'm having the mashed potatoes!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and garlic, lower heat to
                medium, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>When the potatoes are almost finished, heat milk and butter in a small saucepan
                over low heat until butter is melted.
            </li>
            <li>Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Slowly add warm milk mixture, blending it
                in with a potato masher or electric mixer until potatoes are smooth and creamy.
                Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            

        </ol>
