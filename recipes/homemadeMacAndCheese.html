        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A basic recipe that will make your pebbles tumble down the street in the rain.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Macaroni and Cheese</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ozs uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>1/4 cup salted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups milk, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bread Crumb Topping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
            <li>Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite,
                about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the 
                prepared baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low
                heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light
                golden-brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer.
                Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt
                and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has
                thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed. Pour
                cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over
                medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned.
                Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and
                cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
